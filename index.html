    <p class="noindent">Welcome to trance land! I have spent a lot of time in this territory over the past 30 years (I
      know that carbon dates me, but I promise I don’t feel that old), both personally and as a guide for others. I have
      written a couple of other books on trance and its use in change work (<i class="calibre2">Solution-Oriented
        Hypnosis</i> and <i class="calibre2">Taproots</i>, both also published by W.W. Norton) and I decided it was time
      to revisit the subject.</p>

    <p class="indent">Many well-known psychotherapists (Freud, Fritz Perls, developer of Gestalt therapy; Jay Haley,
      creator of strategic therapy; Stephen Gilligan, originator of the self-relations approach; behavioral psychiatrist
      Joseph Wolpe, developer of systematic desensitization; not to mention one of my main influences, Milton Erickson)
      used hypnosis early in their careers, before they went on to develop their unique approaches to change. I don’t
      think this was a coincidence. Hypnosis can teach us many things about how the human mind, perceptions, and
      emotions function. It can also show how to help people shift those perceptions, mental processes, and emotions to
      resolve problems. Recent discoveries in neuroscience have pointed up the amazing plasticity of the brain and the
      mutability of habits (see Norman Doidge’s <i class="calibre2">The Brain That Changes Itself</i> as a prime
      example). Hypnotherapists have known about this plasticity for some <a id="calibre_link-157"
        class="calibre1"></a>time. Just watch a stage hypnotist convince a hypnotized person that the tart lemon he is
      biting into is actually a sweet orange.</p>

    <p class="indent">Many of the practitioners cited above moved on from hypnosis after their early years. Some of us,
      however, stick with hypnosis, as I have over many years. I still haven’t come to the end of what I think I can
      learn from trance. Hypnosis, for me, is an endlessly fascinating subject. At the same time, it has become clearer
      and simpler to me. This book is a result of many years of teaching professionals how to compellingly invite their
      clients into trance and to help those clients reduce or eliminate the suffering that brought them to seek help.
    </p>

    <p class="indent">This book is the third in a line of guidebooks that began with a book I coauthored with Sandy
      Beadle (<i class="calibre2">A Guide to Possibility Land</i>), who did much to shape the form of the text,
      including the images that are scattered throughout the pages. Her research in the area of instructional design
      showed that breaking the points up into small chunks and using images made them more memorable and effective.
      Whether those were the elements that made a difference or not, that first guidebook and the subsequent one (<i
        class="calibre2">A Guide to Inclusive Therapy</i>) proved to be sufficiently popular and brought such nice
      comments that I began hatching a plan to write at least one more.</p>

    <p class="indent">Hypnosis can be intimidating to people, so I have tried to make it friendly, nonintimidating, and
      non-frightening. I hope I have succeeded, and I hope you enjoy this book deeply (and more deeply).</p>

        class="calibre5">Introduction to Solution-Oriented or Ericksonian Hypnosis</a></h2>

    <p class="noindent">There are two major types of hypnosis: authoritarian and permissive. The tradition I practice
      within, which I have come to call solution-oriented hypnosis, is permissive. I studied with the late psychiatrist
      Milton H. Erickson a few years before his death in 1980 (I was actually Erickson’s gardener while I was in
      graduate school studying to be a marriage and family therapist, since I couldn’t afford to pay him for his
      teaching).</p>

    <p class="indent">There are both philosophical and technical differences between authoritarian hypnosis and the
      permissive approach. To illustrate the Ericksonian tradition, let’s start with a story or two.</p>

    <p class="indent">The first was one Dr. Erickson used to tell students quite regularly. When he was a child, growing
      up in rural Wisconsin in the early 1900s, he and some friends came across a horse that had obviously thrown its
      rider. None of them recognized the horse or knew to whom it belonged. After catching the horse and calming it
      down, young Erickson declared that he would take the horse back to its owner. “How are you going to do that?”
      asked his friends. “You don’t even know whose horse this is.”</p>

    <p class="indent">But Erickson just got on the horse and spurred it on. Some miles down the road, the horse veered
      into a farm. When <a id="calibre_link-159" class="calibre1"></a>Erickson and the horse arrived before the waiting
      farmer, he thanked Erickson for bringing the horse home, but asked how he knew to bring the horse there, since
      they didn’t know one another. Erickson replied, “I didn’t know where the horse should go, but he did. I just kept
      him on the road and moving.”</p>

    <p class="indent">That is a cornerstone of the permissive approach to hypnosis: the person knows the way. The
      hypnotherapist’s task is to keep the client moving.</p>

    <p class="indent">The second story is one told by a child psychiatrist who was a student of Erickson’s. Erickson was
      teaching a workshop in San Francisco and the child psychiatrist brought one of his oppositional-defiant teenage
      patients, Ed, to work with Erickson, since he wasn’t making much progress with the boy in treatment. He expected
      Erickson to hypnotize the boy, but when the boy came up and sat before Erickson and the group of workshop
      participants, Erickson mentioned that the psychiatrist had told him about Ed getting into trouble. Erickson then
      looked at Ed and said simply, “I really don’t know how you are going to change your behavior.” Then he thanked Ed
      for coming, and the boy and his psychiatrist left the workshop. The psychiatrist was mystified by this turn of
      events and decided that perhaps Erickson had decided not to work with Ed. But over the <a id="calibre_link-160"
        class="calibre1"></a>next few months the boy showed a remarkable improvement in his situation. When the
      psychiatrist thought back to that brief encounter, he realized that Erickson had actually made an intervention
      that day. He had implied that Ed would change his behavior and then left the boy to his own devices as to how he
      would change it.</p>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000075.jpg" class="calibre7" /></p>

    <p class="indent">These two stories illustrate the main differences between the two hypnotic traditions, both in how
      they approach trance induction and how they approach treatment.</p>

    <p class="indent">Traditional hypnotherapy relies on the authority and power of the hypnotist to “get” the person
      into trance. It also taps into suggestibility, which is required for success in this more authoritarian approach.
      Once the client is in trance, the hypnotherapist has a clear direction for trance (uncovering repressed or
      forgotten trauma that may be creating present problems; implanting new, more positive beliefs; and so on). I see
      this as an outside-in approach. The hypnotist is trying to get new stuff to happen from the outside and is the
      expert on what is going on with the person he or she is treating and what that person needs to do to get better.
    </p>

    <p class="indenta">The solution-oriented approach, in contrast, is based more on evocation than suggestion. Echoing
      the title of a book on Erickson’s work (<i class="calibre2">The Answer Within</i> by Steve and Carol Lankton),
      solution-oriented hypnotherapists hold that people have answers and knowledge within themselves that can be tapped
      and released with the right invitations. The right invitations are the ones that really resonate with a particular
      person. That’s why this approach, while it has a set of generalized guidelines, does not have any formulas. Every
      trance induction is different. Every treatment is different. Some people will discover some repressed memories.
      Others will merely shift their thinking. Still others will perceive strange sensations or colors that will <a
        id="calibre_link-161" class="calibre1"></a>become meaningful and lead them to change. The person is the expert;
      the hypnotherapist is merely the facilitator of the evoked answers or responses.</p>

        Permissive Hypnosis</b></h3>

    <p class="noindent">In authoritarian hypnosis, the hypnotherapist must establish his or her authority to cause
      things to happen with patients or subjects. The phrasing used in this approach typically involves words like <i
        class="calibre2">will, are, won’t</i>, or <i class="calibre2">can’t</i>.</p>

    </div>

    <p class="indent">The hypnotist becomes the authority on the people’s experience (Virginia Satir called this “mind
      reading”), telling them what they are feeling or what they will feel. Or the hypnotherapist becomes the author of
      the experience: He or she tells subjects or patients that they will do something and it happens just as the
      hypnotherapist said it would.</p>

    <p class="indent1">In the permissive tradition, the hypnotherapist uses words like <i class="calibre2">may, can,
        could, might</i>, or <i class="calibre2">don’t have to</i>, and provides multiple options for response.</p>

    <div class="hang">
      <p class="hang1">Some sample phrases in this mode might be:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="hang">
      <p class="hang1">You can go as deeply into trance as is comfortable for you right now.</p>

      <p class="hang1">Your eyes might be feeling heavy. They might stay open and you might just decide to close them on
        your own.</p>

      <p class="hang1">You may go anywhere you want. You don’t even have to listen to what I am saying.</p>

      <p class="hang1">You might not even notice that you are going into trance.</p>

      <p class="hang1">There is no right way or wrong way to respond. You can find your own way of going into trance.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="indent1">In addition to these technical and phrasing differences, there is a philosophical difference in
      these two traditions. The authoritarian <a id="calibre_link-163" class="calibre1"></a>approach views the
      hypnotherapist as the expert who knows both what is wrong with the person seeking help and the appropriate path to
      correct the problem. The hypnotherapist in this tradition might discover or decide that the person has an early
      trauma that has created the current difficulty. The appropriate intervention might then be to age regress the
      person back to that original traumatic experience and rework it. Or it might be to instill new, more helpful
      beliefs about the individual or the situation. Whatever the intervention or the analysis, it typically comes from
      the hypnotherapist.</p>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000077.jpg" class="calibre11" /></p>

    <p class="indent">In contrast, in the permissive approach, the hypnotherapist studiously avoids being the expert on
      the problem or the solution. He or she merely provides a context in which people can come to their own conclusions
      and use whatever resources emerge to solve the problem.</p>

    <p class="indent1">In other words, the permissive approach is evocative rather than suggestive. This difference is
      grounded in a sense that people have resources and wisdom within and in their social contexts.</p>

    <p class="indent1">An authoritarian hypnotherapist might say:</p>

    <div class="extr">
      <p class="extract">Go all the way back to a time before you were 5 years old and find a moment that changed
        everything. Go deeper and deeper into trance and go all the way back.</p>

      <p class="extract">You will be more and more confident in social situations.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="indent1">The person is being directed to do or think or feel something. The hypnotherapist has an idea of
      what will help and suggests a solution or path to solution. It is an outside-in approach. <a id="calibre_link-164"
        class="calibre1"></a>The permissive approach is evocative, an inside-out orientation.</p>

    <p class="indent">Some examples of what a permissive, evocative approach might involve when the person is in trance
      follow:</p>

    <div class="extr">
      <p class="extract">I really don’t know how you will resolve this issue, but I do know that something inside you
        knows what needs to happen and to whom you might need to talk to move forward.</p>

      <p class="extract">You only need to go as deeply as is appropriate to connect with the resources you need to feel
        better and get clear on what is next for you.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="chaptita"><b class="calibre6">Suggestion Versus Evocation</b></h3>

    <p class="noindent">These language distinctions reflect the shift from the old notion of hypnosis as being primarily
      about suggestion and reprogramming to it being about evocation. In this approach to hypnosis, the hypnotherapist
      is not trying to correct some faulty beliefs or traumatically installed thinking by replacing those beliefs or
      thoughts with new, more healthy ones. (I find myself wondering: “healthy” according to whom?) Instead, he or she
      is working to evoke abilities and resources that could resolve the presenting issue.</p>

    <p class="indenta">This is not a trivial difference or mere technical shift: the goals are different.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Here, we’ll take up the minimal elements that can serve to invite a person powerfully and
      compellingly into trance using this approach.</p>

    <p class="indent">I have divided these methods into elements (and sometimes subelements within the main method) to
      make them easy to learn. Obviously in hypnotherapeutic practice, many of these are used together or
      simultaneously. But for learning purposes, making them discrete elements makes them easier to distinguish and
      master.</p>

        class="calibre5">1. Permission</a></p>

    <p class="noindent">Your task in using the skills offered in this first section is to create an atmosphere of
      acceptance, comfort, nonintrusion, and validation in which the person cannot fail or do anything wrong. This safe
      and nonpressurized atmosphere goes a long way toward dissolving any resistance or barriers most people have about
      going into trance. If you do this part well, the rest of the induction and treatment will typically go more
      smoothly and easily.</p>

    <p class="indent">Erickson had this notion he called <i class="calibre2">utilization</i>. He considered it to be one
      of his two original contributions to the field of hypnosis (the other being the interspersal technique, which
      we’ll cover in a later section). The essence of utilization is that the hypnotherapist should accept and use
      whatever the person presents as part and parcel of the trance and the treatment. If people pace back and forth in
      the office, the hypnotherapist does not insist that they sit down, uncross their arms and legs, or relax and close
      their eyes before beginning the trance. No, the pacing will be accepted and used as the way a person will start
      the trance.</p>

    <p class="indent">I was hypnotizing a 10-year-old boy and he began to giggle during the trance induction. I said,
      “What a nice way to go into <a id="calibre_link-170" class="calibre1"></a>trance; to giggle your way in.” This
      resulted in him giggling even harder. I responded, “Most adults are so serious about trance, but I think giggling
      might be a fun way to go deeper.” I kept on in this vein for a time, adding the other elements that you will read
      about in this book, and gradually he stopped giggling. When he began to emerge from the trance about 30 minutes
      later, however, he giggled his way out of trance. This young man had the giggle method of going into and coming
      out of trance.</p>

    <p class="indent">Another person I worked with kept up a running commentary on what was happening within her as she
      went into trance: “Oh, my eyes are getting heavy; I am starting to see colors in my mind, purples and green; my
      hands are getting numb; this is interesting.” Now, most people don’t speak much as they are going into trance, but
      there is no law against it. She had the commentary method of going into trance.</p>

    <p class="indent">Yet another person wiggled around in his chair while going into trance. Most people become more
      still, but he had the wiggle method of going into trance. I accepted and validated this behavior as a legitimate
      way of going into trance.</p>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000028.jpg" class="calibre16" /></p>

    <p class="indent">The point: each person has his or her own method of going into trance. In this approach, none of
      it is seen as resistance, only the person’s unique response and experience. Any response (short of people doing
      violence to themselves or others) is seen as acceptable and even encouraged and included as part of the hypnotic
      process rather than a block to it.</p>

    <p class="indent">There are several variations on this method, which are detailed in the sections that follow.</p>

    <h3 class="chaptita"><b class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-171" class="calibre1"></a><a id="calibre_link-172"
          class="calibre1"></a><a href="#calibre_link-100" id="calibre_link-27" class="calibre1">1.1 Accept, Normalize,
          Reassure and Validate Whatever the Person Presents</a></b></h3>

    <p class="noindent">To create an atmosphere in which it is easy for people to go into trance, actively accept
      whatever experience they are having. Give them the sense that whatever they are doing is okay and part of the
      process of going into trance. This includes any concerns, fears, resistance, or distractions they may have.</p>

    <p class="indent">When people first encounter hypnosis, they often have either fixed ideas of what hypnosis is
      (“I’ll be knocked out and won’t hear or know a thing”) or they have fears (“Someone will control me and make me do
      things I wouldn’t want to do in my everyday life”). So I often spend a little time eliciting those ideas or
      concerns and reassuring them that those things are not what hypnosis is about. Or I reassure them that those
      concerns are normal and common.</p>

    <p class="indent">When they are going into trance, while they are in trance, or after trance, I sometimes do the
      same thing: I reassure them that their trance experiences are part of the spectrum of things that people typically
      experience with hypnosis.</p>

          To</a></b></h3>

    <p class="noindent">There are typically two varieties of permission we use in induction: <i
        class="calibre2">permission to</i> and <i class="calibre2">permission not to have to. Permission to</i> is
      accomplished by using words and phrases such as <i class="calibre2">You can</i>, It’s <i class="calibre2">okay to,
        You might, You are okay if you, You could</i>, and so on. Either imagine or elicit from your clients what they
      are experiencing that might be a distraction, a barrier, or a concern for them and give them permission to have
      that experience or concern. This typically dissolves that concern or makes it less of a barrier to the induction.

    <p class="noindent">This, then, is the first skill you need to master to do skillful hypnosis in this style. You
      need to be able to help people feel comfortable and not pressured. You also need to be able to make a solid
      connection with them, which the methods in this first section can help you do.</p>

    <p class="indent">Validation involves giving the verbal and nonverbal message that the person’s experience and style
      of responding are valid and within the range of normal or legitimate experience and response.</p>

    <p class="indent">Possibilities language is all about not boxing yourself or your clients in during the induction.
      There should be no way for them or you to fail during induction. Every response is included and there is no
      pressure to “do it right.” Giving multiple options for legitimate response is a good way to use possibilities
      language.</p>

    <p class="indent"><b class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-183" class="calibre1"></a>Hypnotherapist:</b> Your mind

    <p class="indent">Connecting is all about keeping connected to people while you are doing trance by avoiding saying

        class="calibre5">2. Presuppositon</a></p>

    <p class="noindent">The coauthor of the first book I wrote, <i class="calibre2">Shifting Contexts</i>, was Jim Wilk.
      Jim was a very future-oriented person, sometimes too much so (he was always thinking that his ship would come in
      and pay off his substantial debts). Once, we were talking on the phone and he mentioned that someone had hired him
      to give a workshop on Ericksonian hypnosis. “What are you going to do?” I asked, since I knew he had only read
      about but never actually practiced hypnosis. “I’ll practice in the months before I have to give the presentation,”
      he replied confidently.</p>

    <p class="indent">Well, time rolled on. Jim’s workplace wouldn’t give him permission to use hypnosis in his work and
      he never did get a chance to practice. After he presented the workshop, I asked him how it went. “Fantastic!”</p>

    <p class="indent">“Did you do any demonstrations?”</p>

    <p class="indent">“Oh, yes. They went well.”</p>

    <p class="indent">“My God, Jim, you are incredible. How did you pull it off?”</p>

    <p class="indent">“Well, when it came time to do the demonstrations, I was terrified. But I came up with an idea. I
      would just imagine that Milton Erickson was standing right behind me actually doing the hypnosis and all I had to
      do was report what was happening and speculate on what was likely to happen.”</p>

    <p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-185" class="calibre1"></a>So he would say things like, “I see that your
      eyelids are fluttering. I wonder whether you know you are going into a trance.” Or, “How deeply will you go into a
      trance? Neither one of us knows, but we will find out.” Or, “Which hand will lift up first? We’ll have to wait to
      discover which one your unconscious chooses.”</p>

    <p class="indent">That way, Jim took the pressure off himself. But what he was actually doing was a lot of
      presupposing without telling the person to do anything. He assumed that Erickson would get the person into trance
      and help him or her develop hand levitation.</p>

    <p class="indent">This is a good strategy to use as a hypnotherapist. You don’t actually have to make anyone do
      anything. You can make indirect invitations.</p>

    <p class="indent">Erickson himself had a very striking example of using presupposition to induce trance.</p>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000070.jpg" class="calibre21" /></p>

    <p class="indent">One time when he was giving a workshop, Dr. Erickson announced that he wanted to give a
      demonstration of hypnosis. He called for a volunteer from the participants in the workshop and when one came up on
      stage and seated himself, Erickson merely looked at him without saying a word. The person went into trance, then
      Erickson began to do some work with him. After the demonstration was completed, participants were curious. Did
      Erickson use “psychic induction”? He seemed to put the person into trance without doing anything. Erickson
      explained, “I had defined the situation as one in which trance would be demonstrated. He came up and when I didn’t
      do anything, he went into trance. It was implied that he would go into trance.”</p>

    <p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-186" class="calibre1"></a>So your task using this set of skills is to presume
      that the person will go into trance and have various hypnotic experiences. (Later I will suggest using the same
      method to bring about the therapeutic changes you and the client are aiming for.)</p>

    <h3 class="chaptita1"><b class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-187" class="calibre1"></a><a href="#calibre_link-120"
          id="calibre_link-33" class="calibre1">2.1 Before</a></b></h3>

    <p class="noindent">One of the easiest presuppositions to use is the “before” form of presupposition. This is where
      you assume that the person is going to go into trance sometime in the future.</p>

    <p class="indentte">Read these two questions:</p>

    <div class="extr">
      <p class="extract">Have you ever been in trance?</p>

      <p class="extract">Have you ever been in trance before?</p>
    </div>

    <p class="indentt">The person you ask either of these questions may answer the same way, but the implication in the
      second question is different. The second question implies that sometime in the future (the near future if they
      have come to you for trance work), the person will be going into a trance.</p>

    <div class="extr">
      <p class="indent"><b class="calibre6">Hypnotherapist:</b> Before you go into trance, I want to talk with you about

    <p class="noindent">This form of presupposition is the opposite of the “before” form. Here you are presuming that
      the person will go into a <a id="calibre_link-189" class="calibre1"></a>trance by mentioning or asking about
      things that will or could occur after the trance is over.</p>

      <p class="indent">You can also use verb tense in a deliberate way to imply the end of trance.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="extr">

    <p class="noindent">In this third form of presupposition, you never doubt that the person will go into trance, but
      only speculate or ask about the rate at which he or she will go into trance.</p>

    <div class="extr">
      <p class="indent"><b class="calibre6">Hypnotherapist:</b> How quickly do you think you can go into trance? I don’t

    <p class="noindent">Initially, timing may seem the same as rate, but this form of presupposition speculates or asks

    <p class="noindent">In this form of presupposition, you are speculating or asking about how deeply the person will
      go into trance. Remember, you are not questioning or casting doubt on whether the person will enter trance, only
      the depth of the trance.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Although I have discussed verb tenses in earlier parts of this section, let’s visit this skill
      in more detail. Erickson used verb tenses in various ways&mdash;to imply change and trance, to shift time
      orientation, and to confuse. (“And you will then have known what I will have been expecting you to have learned,”
      I once heard him say.)</p>

    <p class="indent">To keep things simple, we’ll stick to the past, present, and future.</p>

    <p class="indent">For example, if you would like to invite the person to more fully experience something that is in
      the past or the future, you could switch to the present tense.</p>

    <div class="extr">
      <p class="indent"><b class="calibre6">Hypnotherapist:</b> Where are you now? What are you seeing?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="extr">
      <p class="indent"><b class="calibre6">Hypnotherapist:</b> Okay, it’s now 5 years in the future and you have gotten
        through that trouble you had so many years <a id="calibre_link-199" class="calibre1"></a>ago and come out the
        other side long ago. What are you doing in your life right now?</p>

      <p class="indent">As we discussed earlier, if you wanted to imply that trance was over without formally telling
        the person to come out of trance, you could use the past tense:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="extr">
      <p class="indent"><b class="calibre6">Hypnotherapist:</b> How was that? Was that different from what you expected?
      </p>

      <p class="indentt">Obviously there are many variations on the use of verb tense and some of you may want to
        explore this skill more, but we will leave it there for now.</p>

        class="calibre5">3. Splitting</a></p>

    <p class="noindent">The human mind has a tendency to split things apart, to make distinctions. In Western cultures
      we divide our calendars into <small class="calibre26">B.C.</small> and <small class="calibre26">A.D.</small> We
      divide the day up into hours and minutes; the year into days and months and seasons. We can use this tendency to
      facilitate the process of trance induction and treatment. This is called <i class="calibre2">splitting</i>. By
      splitting I mean two things: dividing previously unified concepts or experiences into parts or creating new
      distinctions.</p>

    <h3 class="chaptita"><a id="calibre_link-201" class="calibre1"></a><b class="calibre6"><a href="#calibre_link-143"
          id="calibre_link-42" class="calibre1">3.1 Make Distinctions</a></b></h3>

    <p class="noindent">In hypnosis, the distinctions we propose are often between the conscious and the unconscious,
      but they could be between any aspect of experience and another aspect of experience. We could propose, as did
      Descartes, a split between the mind and the body. Or between the front of the mind and the back of the mind. Or
      one part of the person and another part.</p>

    <div class="extr">

          Parts</a></b></h3>

    <p class="noindent">Here the hypnotherapist reconsiders something previously thought of as one thing, instead
      breaking it down into at least two parts. This is sometimes done to bypass resistance and sometimes to shift
      thinking.</p>

    <div class="extr">

          Nonverbally as Well as Verbally</a></b></h3>

    <p class="noindent">It’s possible and important to make splits nonverbally as well as verbally. Nonverbal splitting
      is usually done using different voice tones, voice volumes, and spatial locations for the voice. If the person’s
      eyes are open, there could be visual splitting.</p>

    <p class="indent">Erickson often used different voice tones and volumes when he was speaking about the unconscious
      than when he was speaking about conscious processes. He also often leaned to one side when speaking of the
      unconscious and to the other when speaking of the conscious. That way, even when the person’s eyes were closed, he
      or she could hear these changes (often not consciously noticing them) and respond appropriately to the
      distinction.</p>

    <p class="noindent">The element complementary to splitting is <i class="calibre2">linking</i>, which involves
      joining together two previously unrelated or unlinked concepts or experiences. You could also think of this as
      creating associations. Again, this seems to be a natural human tendency. You eat a certain food and become ill,
      and after that unpleasant experience, that food tends to bring up unpleasant gastro-intestinal sensations (sorry
      about the pun). In this hypnotic skill, the hypnotherapist is deliberately proposing associations for hypnotic and
      therapeutic purposes.</p>

      concept, and I encourage you to be creative.</p>

    <p class="hang2">While you ____, you can ____.</p>

    <p class="indent">Like splitting, linking is often done nonverbally. As an example, Erickson once did this with a
      man who paced back and forth in his office and spoke in an anxious, hurried way. He told Erickson he was so
      anxious that he couldn’t sit down and talk about his problem; he was on the verge of running out of the office,
      and pacing and talking compulsively was all that was keeping him there. Erickson began speaking very quickly to
      the man, matching his rate of speech and walking. Erickson then almost imperceptibly slowed his rate of speech and
      the man began slowing his own walking and speaking. The two had become linked.</p>

      his polio and its aftereffects, his handwriting was a bit uneven.</p>

    <p class="indent">He told me that the phrase he had written was a reproduction of a note that was given to a staff
      member of a psychiatric hospital in which he had worked by a patient who had never spoken a word during his
      hospitalization. The staff all looked at the note and couldn’t decipher any useful meaning in it. But Erickson
      could. He asked me what the patient was trying to communicate. I couldn’t work it out.</p>

    <p class="indent1">Here is the note:</p>

    <p class="extract1">I AM GOING to a place where there are no bad, MAD people.</p>

  <div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-114">
    <p class="h1"><a id="calibre_link-212" class="calibre5"></a><a href="#calibre_link-115" id="calibre_link-48"
        class="calibre5">5. Interspersal</a></p>

    <p class="noindent">Erickson thought he had made two original and unique contributions to the practice of hypnosis.
      Interspersal was one of them (the other was utilization). Interspersal is a combination of splitting and linking.
      Some parts of the communication from the hypnotist to the person are nonverbally emphasized (and are thus linked
      to one another) and therefore are split off from the rest of the message.</p>

    <p class="indent">Erickson maintained that people communicate like this quite regularly, so the hypnotherapist is
      just using a form of complex communication that everyone understands at an unconsciously processed level. He said
      sometimes his patients would be talking about some subject and would emphasize a word or phrase, thereby alerting
      Erickson to one of their concerns. For example, the person would be talking about a problem at work and say: “I’ve
      just got to divorce myself from my boss’s criticism. I can’t let him tear me down.” Erickson would eventually
      inquire about the person’s marriage.</p>

    <p class="indent">In the example in the box at left (A Cryptic Communication), the answer to the riddle was that the
      patient was trying to say, without saying, that he was going mad. It turned out that he was terrified. If he spoke
      his fears aloud, he was certain they <a id="calibre_link-213" class="calibre1"></a>would become real. Therefore he
      had to disguise the message, because he was desperate to get help but couldn’t say what he was worried about.</p>

    <p class="indent">So, interspersal is nonverbally emphasizing or distinguishing certain words or phrases to create a
      message within a message. This can be accomplished using several nonverbal channels.</p>

    <h3 class="chaptita"><a id="calibre_link-214" class="calibre1"></a><b class="calibre6"><a href="#calibre_link-116"
          id="calibre_link-49" class="calibre1">5.1 Emphasizing Through Voice Volume</a></b></h3>

    <p class="noindent">The first channel involves slightly lowering or raising your voice volume on the words or
      phrases you want to intersperse. It doesn’t particularly matter if you raise or lower your voice volume. The main
      thing is to link a consistent shift to certain phrases.</p>

    <p class="indent">In the examples below, the bold words or phrases are the interspersed ones.</p>

    <p class="indent">I like to joke that we parents are sometimes very poor hypnotists. “Don’t <b

        class="calibre5">6. Introduction to the Other Elements</a></p>

    <p class="noindent">In this chapter, I will discuss some other helpful elements in creating a trance. Because each
      of them only merits a short discussion, I have put them all in one chapter rather than devoting a whole chapter to
      each, as I did with the previous elements. We’ll cover Description, Truisms, Matching, Guiding Attention and
      Associations, and the Confusion Technique.</p>

    <h3 class="chaptita"><a id="calibre_link-219" class="calibre1"></a><b class="calibre6"><a href="#calibre_link-135"
          id="calibre_link-52" class="calibre1">6.1 Description</a></b></h3>

    <p class="noindent">When doing hypnosis, it is important to maintain both connection and credibility with subjects.
      One way to do this is to describe only what you can verify with your senses that the person is showing you. That
      means you must be careful not to assume or guess about internal states and processes, because if you are wrong or
      off in your guesses or interpretations, it might be jarring to the person and disrupt his or her experience and
      your connection with him or her.</p>

    <p class="indent">Erickson did a dramatic demonstration one time to illustrate the importance of observing and not
      going beyond the evidence of your senses. He arranged for a person to enter a lecture hall, walking in only a few
      steps. He had arranged the students <a id="calibre_link-220" class="calibre1"></a>on both sides of the room and
      then asked them to write down a description of the person. After a short time, the person walked the several steps
      backward out of the lecture hall, never turning around.</p>

    <p class="indent">When some of the students began to read their written description of the person, the point of the
      exercise quickly became clear. Students on the right side of the room described a person who had blue eyes, and
      students on the left side of the room described a person who had green eyes. It turned out the person had two
      different colored eyes. Erickson emphasized to the students that he was training them to observe and not go beyond
      what they could directly observe. The lesson stuck.</p>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000021.jpg" class="calibre32" /></p>

    <p class="indent">This skill, then, has two components: observation and description. But what you will say to the
      subject involves description. To do this well, you must observe carefully and well. That is why I usually
      recommend sitting directly in front of the person, with a full view of the front of his or her body.</p>

    <p class="indent">Description is telling people what you can observe about their behavior on an ongoing basis,
      especially mentioning those things that are changing. This has the effect of garnering credibility for you, as
      well as directing their attention to those aspects of their experience.</p>

    <div class="extr">

          id="calibre_link-53" class="calibre1">6.2 Truisms</a></b></h3>

    <p class="noindent">Truisms are statements that are obviously true and don’t require observation or guessing about
      what the person is experiencing. Trusims go beyond observation, but are typically not jarring (as guessing
      incorrectly about a person’s experience might be). Truisms might also be statements that sound generally true but
      that are hard to check.</p>

          class="calibre1"></a><a href="#calibre_link-137" id="calibre_link-54" class="calibre1">6.3 Matching</a></b>
    </h3>

    <p class="noindent">Matching involves the hypnotherapist aligning some parts of his or her behavior or communication
      with something similar in the client’s behavior. Another aspect of matching is to carefully attend to things that
      are changing and match those changes.</p>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2">6.3.1 Matching rhythm</i></h4>

    <p class="noindent">Typically, the hypnotist in this approach matches the rhythm of his speaking with the rhythm of
      the person’s breathing, but there are other ways to match rhythms as well. You might notice that a person is
      moving her foot up and down in a regular way and then match your speaking rhythm to that rhythm as you begin to do
      trance, or throughout the whole hypnotic session.</p>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2">6.3.2 Matching Body Behavior</i></h4>

    <p class="noindent">The hypnotist sometimes mirrors the person’s posture or movements as a way of joining and
      connecting. For example, when a person crosses and uncrosses his legs, the hypnotist also crosses and uncrosses
      her legs. Another way to match body behavior is to vary some part of your behavior when the person changes his
      body behavior. That is, every time he blinks, you nod.</p>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2">6.3.3 Matching Voice Tone</i></h4>

    <p class="noindent">Some people speak in a high-pitched voice; some speak in a very low voice. As much as possible,
      when you use this skill, match the tone of voice. Of course, be careful not to be mocking <a id="calibre_link-225"
        class="calibre1"></a>or obvious. A slight shift in your voice tone might be enough.</p>

    <p class="indent">Also, I wouldn’t recommend matching every voice tone. For example, if the person is angry or
      weeping, it would rarely be appropriate for you to match those tones.</p>

    <p class="indent">You can match various aspects of voice tone, such as pitch, timbre, and emphasis.</p>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2">6.3.4 Matching Voice Volume</i></h4>

    <p class="noindent">Similar to the previous skill, match the volume or voice level of the person. If they raise the
      volume of their voice or drop to a whisper, you can adjust the volume of your voice in the same direction.</p>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000056.jpg" class="calibre34" /></p>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2">6.3.5 Matching Grammar or Vocabulary</i></h4>

    <p class="noindent">Erickson was treating a man who came in and exclaimed something like: “I know I ain’t no damn
      good and you most probably won’t want to see a goddamned guy like me, but mister, I need some help ’cause I can’t
      no way help myself.” He threw some crumpled dollar bills on Erickson’s desk, then turned to leave the office.</p>

    <p class="indent">Erickson replied: “Where the hell are you going? I do the doctorin’ around here and you better
      listen to whatever the hell I say. Now sit yourself down and listen to me, damn it.” This is a dramatic example,
      but you can do something similar to match the person with whom you are working.</p>

    <p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-226" class="calibre1"></a>I was working with a woman using hypnosis and after
      she emerged from the trance, she mentioned to me that every time I used the word unconscious (my preferred term),
      she saw herself being wheeled into the operating theatre having been given drugs to make her unconscious. She
      preferred the term subconscious. I used that term in subsequent sessions, and this troubling image never
      reappeared.</p>

    <p class="indent">Again, it is important to be careful here and not come across as mocking or disrespectful when
      using this method.</p>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000071.jpg" class="calibre35" /></p>

    <h3 class="chaptita"><a id="calibre_link-227" class="calibre1"></a><b class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-228"
          class="calibre1"></a><a href="#calibre_link-138" id="calibre_link-55" class="calibre1">6.4 Guiding Attention
          and Associations</a></b></h3>

    <p class="noindent">Whatever you mention might have an influence on the person’s thinking, images, and associations.
      The stories you tell and the words and phrases you use are likely to call forth certain things from the person
      with whom you are working. So, be careful and be mindful of what you choose to speak about.</p>

    <p class="indent">For example, if you tell a story about someone getting divorced, you are likely to guide people to
      think about divorce, either ones that have touched them in the past or the possibility of a current or future
      divorce.</p>

    <p class="indent">In contrast, if you mention pleasant memories, people will be more likely to conjure up their own
      pleasant memories.</p>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000001.jpg" class="calibre36" /></p>

    <p class="indent">In a famous video of Erickson’s work (<i class="calibre2">The Artistry of Milton H. Erickson</i>),
      Erickson mentions to the subject, Mondi, that he was working with a woman a few nights before and she remembered
      something from the time before she was 5 years old. He then mentions that the woman thought of a happy memory of
      <a id="calibre_link-229" class="calibre1"></a>a pet she had. Later, Erickson suggests that Mondi remember and
      revivify an earlier memory. It is no coincidence that Mondi remembers a pleasant memory of a time before she was 5
      years old. It even involved animals (she recalls splashing in a pond with ducks).
    </p>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000016.jpg" class="calibre37" /></p>

    <p class="indent">I often find myself telling stories to a person in trance and notice that I have included details
      of the story that I have never mentioned before when I have told that particular story. Later the person often
      reports something significant related to that previously untold detail, so I assume my nonconscious mind has had a
      sense of what kinds of associations might be helpful to evoke in this person.</p>

    <p class="indent">What I am suggesting is that you avoid creating associations with unpleasant topics like pain,
      failure, and the like, unless you have a very deliberate reason for bringing these things into the person’s
      experience.</p>

    <div class="extr">
      <p class="indent"><b class="calibre6">Hypnotherapist:</b> There are many things you can experience in trance. You
        might experience time changing in some direction. You know how when you are with friends out to dinner and the
        conversation is engaging, you might look up after a time and notice all the waiters and the restaurant staff
        waiting for you to go home. You hadn’t even noticed that hours had passed. Perhaps you hadn’t even tasted your
        food. You were just absorbed in the conversation.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="indent">In this example, the person would probably be guided to thinking about or remembering friends,
      food, and restaurants, as well as being invited to time distortion.</p>

    <h3 class="chaptita"><a id="calibre_link-230" class="calibre1"></a><b class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-231"
          class="calibre1"></a><a href="#calibre_link-139" id="calibre_link-56" class="calibre1">6.5 The Confusion
          Technique</a></b></h3>

    <p class="noindent">Erickson had the idea that much resistance in hypnosis (and therapy) arises from the conscious
      mind. When this was interfering, he occasionally used a method he called the confusion technique. He would use a
      long series of complicated verbalizations that had the ultimate effect of “knocking out” the person’s conscious
      control by overwhelming its processing abilities, thereby letting them more easily go into trance.</p>

    <p class="indent">He had several methods of doing this, but the easiest to teach is one in which the hypnotist uses
      two or more pairs of opposite concepts and begins mixing and matching them in various ways.</p>

    <p class="indent">Let’s take the opposites: now/then, forget/remember, and conscious/unconscious.</p>

    <div class="extr">
      <p class="indent"><b class="calibre6">Hypnotherapist:</b> Now you can be conscious of certain unconscious
        processes and one could be unconscious about certain conscious things and there are things that one might be
        conscious of now that then one can forget to remember and can now and then remember to forget. These forgettings
        can be memorable now, but if I asked you about them later, you might then not remember that you forgot them.
        That is, consciously, you might not remember but your unconscious mind is likely to remember now what your
        unconscious forgot then. So, then, how does your unconscious decide what to remember, what to make conscious and
        what to forget, and what to keep unconscious? I don’t really know how to explain it all, but you don’t really
        have to understand. You can just go into trance in the way that is right for you.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-232" class="calibre1"></a>Now let’s use another set of opposites: you/me,
      notice/ignore, and this/that.</p>

    <div class="extr">
      <p class="indent"><b class="calibre6">Hypnotherapist:</b> You can notice what you notice. You may notice you. You
        may notice me. You may notice me noticing you. You may notice you noticing this or that. This is something you
        can ignore or attend to. Your unconscious mind can be put on notice to notice this or it can be put on notice to
        notice that. The me in you and the you in me are interacting in various ways at the conscious and unconscious
        level. You can notice anything about you or about me that you do and you can also ignore what you notice or
        attend to what you have been ignoring or will ignore. You might say that ignorance is bliss and maybe not.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="indent">The cumulative effect of this series of verbalizations is that the person stops tracking what you
      are saying consciously and gives up to go into trance.</p>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000035.jpg" class="calibre38" /></p>

    <p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-233" class="calibre1"></a>This can be a tricky, manipulative method, so I
      suggest you use it sparingly. I only employ it when the person I am working with has a mind that just won’t quit
      and that is getting in the way of his or her going into trance.</p>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000051.jpg" class="calibre39" /></p>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000026.jpg" class="calibre8" /></p>

    <p class="center"><b class="calibre6">Experiment: Try the Confusion Technique</b></p>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000005.jpg" class="calibre9" /></p>

    <p class="noindent1">Come up with your own set of opposite concepts. Start with two pairs. Write them down to help
      you remember and keep track of them and begin to weave them into a series of statements or questions. You might
      try writing some things out first or just jump in and start talking. It may take you two or three tries to get the
      hang of this. Not only is it a skill that you need to develop to use, but it can be confusing for the person who
      is using the method as well.</p>

    <p class="noindent">When I first became a therapist, I learned that one of the skills I needed to develop was the
      ability to help people get specific and concrete when describing their problem situations. The language of trance
      is almost a mirror image of this specific and concrete focus.</p>

    <p class="indent">You need to develop skills like the most abstract and obscure lecturer you have ever heard to
      master the language of trance. Or think of the most confusing and unspecific friend or acquaintance you have,
      someone you have trouble understanding.</p>

    <p class="indent">There is a set of language skills and methods we will examine here. Like any new language, it will
      probably be a little awkward at first and take some practice. But like any new language, you can learn and master
      it.</p>

    <h3 class="chaptita"><a id="calibre_link-238" class="calibre1"></a><b class="calibre6"><a href="#calibre_link-7"
          id="calibre_link-59" class="calibre1">7.1 Use Passive Language</a></b></h3>

    <p class="noindent">One way to facilitate trance is to use passive language. Writing instructors typically warn
      writers away from using passive voice, a language form that drops out actors from sentences. “The plates were
      picked up from the table and put in the sink” <a id="calibre_link-239" class="calibre1"></a>is a good example, as
      it leaves out the person who picked up the dishes. Writing comes more alive when it is written in a more active
      voice. It is the opposite of this approach to evoking trance. I encourage you to use passive voice. Or to put that
      last sentence in passive language: You are encouraged to use the passive voice.</p>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2">7.1.1 Drop the Actor and Willfulness Out of the Sentence</i></h4>

    <p class="noindent">The first way to create passive language is to drop out the actor in the sentence. The second
      method is to use nominalization, or turning a verb into a noun.</p>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000029.jpg" class="calibre42" /></p>

    <p class="indent">Instead of saying, “You can relax,” the passive language way of saying the same thing is
      “Relaxation can happen.” Passive language drops the willfulness from the statement or question. This is important
      because trance is more of an allowing than a willful, effortful experience.</p>

    <div class="extr">
      <p class="indent"><b class="calibre6">Hypnotherapist:</b> Many things can occur during trance. Various shifts may
        happen in your body, in your mind, in your emotions. Noticing these things can just happen or not, but no
        concern or attention needs to be paid to them if they are not of concern. That’s right … just allowing …
        whatever happens … to unfold in its own way … at its own pace.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="extr">
      <p class="indent"><b class="calibre6">Hypnotherapist:</b> Attention can wander to the furniture of the room, to
        the breathing, to the voice, to the wandering thoughts, to the shifting sensations, or anything else that
        captures the attention.</p>
    </div>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2"><a id="calibre_link-240" class="calibre1"></a>7.1.2 Turn Verbs into
        Nouns</i></h4>

    <p class="noindent">Nomalization has a double effect of dropping out the actor as well as making the words very
      abstract, often leading the person to give up trying to decode specifics. To do this, just think of a verb and
      make a noun of it, then use it during an induction or trance.</p>

    <p class="indent1">Here are some examples of verbs and the nouns that you could turn them into:</p>

    <p class="indent">Communicate <img alt="" src="images/000027.jpg" class="calibre43" /> Communication</p>

    <p class="indent">Think <img alt="" src="images/000027.jpg" class="calibre43" /> Thoughts</p>

    <p class="indent">Be afraid <img alt="" src="images/000027.jpg" class="calibre43" /> Fear</p>

    <div class="extr">
      <p class="indent"><b class="calibre6">Hypnotherapist:</b> Communication can occur between the conscious and the
        unconscious, but awareness doesn’t necessarily occur when it happens. Various processes that are part of
        everyday experience are not always accessible to our awareness, and that is probably generally a good thing.
        Thoughts drift through the mind and we don’t have to attend to them or act on them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="extr">
      <p class="indent"><b class="calibre6">Hypnotherapist:</b> There are thoughts that can come to you in trance,
        thoughts that you can think, thoughts that can think you. These thoughts can influence feelings, sensations,
        awarenesses, conclusions, and experiences. You can have thoughts about thoughts, thoughts about feelings,
        feelings about thoughts, and feelings about feelings.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="extr">
      <p class="indent"><b class="calibre6">Hypnotherapist:</b> Fear can be a friend or it can be an enemy. How you
        relate to fear can change and shift over the course of moments or the course of your life. You can stop and look
        fear in the eye; you can walk through fear; you can use it <a id="calibre_link-241" class="calibre1"></a>as a
        signal. As Roosevelt said, “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself,” which seems like a paradox. You can
        learn to be comfortable with fear.</p>
    </div>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2">7.1.2 Use Empty Words</i></h4>

    <p class="noindent">I sometimes call these words politician or preacher words. Why? Because politicians and
      preachers are often speaking to a large group of people and they avoid getting too specific to ensure that
      listeners can make their own meanings (and politicians often don’t want to be pinned down to specifics). So, in
      this method, avoid the use of sensory-specific words and phrases that are easy to pin down to specific times,
      people, places, actions, or things. Get as vague as possible. Think of how a fairy tale starts: “Long ago, far
      away, there lived a young man who possessed a curious object and this is the story of what he did and what
      happened to him as a result….” In the story, this invites us to get involved and use our imaginations to fill in
      the details. In a trance, empty words invite us to use our imaginations and get more involved in our inner life as
      well as fill in the blanks with our specific desires and details.</p>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000060.jpg" class="calibre44" /></p>

    <p class="indent">Typical empty phrases and words include: <i class="calibre2">Many, some, things, various,
        sometimes, some people</i>, and <i class="calibre2">do</i>.</p>

    <p class="noindent">In this chapter, I will deviate from the listing and detailing of skills and give you a
      bird’s-eye view of hypnosis: what it is, what it is good for, and what you do during trance to help people realize
      clinical results. Then we’ll go back to breaking down the process into specific skills.</p>

    <p class="indent">First, how do you recognize that a person is in trance? Well, that is individualized. Everyone may
      have their own signs, both internal and observable by others, that let you and them know that they are in trance.
      There are some common indicators, however, and I have listed them below.</p>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000010.jpg" class="calibre46" /></p>

          Indicators</a></b></h3>

    <div class="hang">
      <p class="hanging">• Flattening of facial muscles</p>

      <p class="hanging">• Change in skin color</p>

      <p class="hanging">• Immobility or lack of orienting movements</p>

      <p class="hanging">• Decrease in orienting movements</p>

      <p class="hanging">• Limb (hand or arm typically) stays in place (often called catalepsy)</p>

      <p class="hanging">• Perseveration of response (for example, the head keeps nodding long after the person has
        nodded to indicate yes)</p>

      <p class="hanging">• Literalism (for example, if you ask, “Can you tell me your middle name,” the person would
        answer, “Yes, I can.”)</p>

      <p class="hanging">• Relaxed muscles (not universal; sometimes people are not relaxed at all in trance)</p>
    </div>

    <p class="indent1">Subjectively, people often report that they lose track of time, see washes of color
      (interestingly, often purple, one of Erickson’s, and Mesmer’s, preferred colors), feel time is slowed down or sped
      up, lose track of some aspect of their body or physical sensations, feel split off from some part of their
      experience, or drift from one thought, feeling, or sensation to another, and so on. We’ll go more into these
      subjective shifts in a future section (on trance phenomena).</p>

          States</a></b></h3>

    <p class="noindent">Have you noticed that I haven’t defined trance yet? Well, in this section, I’ll begin that
      process. There are many kinds of altered states: meditative states, drug-induced altered states, being lost in a
      fascinating book or movie, being in a flow state, spiritual ecstasy, and so on. Hypnotic trance is one form of
      altered state, but they all have some common elements&mdash;four, to be precise. I call these the four doorways
      into trance.</p>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2">8.2.1 Rhythm</i></h4>

    <p class="noindent">In shamanic ceremonies, altered states are often induced by rhythmic drumming. Something in us
      seems to respond to rhythm. Perhaps it is our ever-present heartbeat, or that of our mother when we were in her
      womb, or perhaps the rhythm of our breathing, that lends us to entrainment on rhythm. Whatever it is, regularly
      repeated rhythms such as music, rocking, regular breathing, sing-song patterns of speaking, and other rhythmic
      patterns can lull us into altered states.</p>

    <p class="indent">The ones we most commonly use in this approach to hypnosis are voice rhythms. I trained myself
      initially to speak only when people exhaled. This slowed me down, gave a cue to the person that some kind of
      conversation was going on that was different from everyday conversation, and provided a regular rhythm to invite
      the person into an altered state.</p>

    <div class="extr">
      <p class="indent"><b class="calibre6">Hypnotherapist:</b> [Watching the person’s breathing rise and fall for a
        time before speaking] And you can … [speaking when the person exhales and stopping as soon as the breathing out
        stops] let yourself … just … be … where you are … even if …</p>
    </div>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000007.jpg" class="calibre47" /></p>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2"><a id="calibre_link-248" class="calibre1"></a>8.2.2 Defocusing
        Attention</i></h4>

    <p class="noindent">Another aspect of altered state induction, defocused attention, is akin to listening to a boring
      lecture or just spacing out while sitting or driving a long distance on a straight highway and finding you haven’t
      noticed the road for a while but your mind was active the whole time. We can invite people to this type of
      experience through our inductions.</p>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000022.jpg" class="calibre48" /></p>

    <div class="extr">
      <p class="indent"><b class="calibre6">Hypnotherapist:</b> You can recall times when you were just drifting, not
        thinking of anything in particular. Hypnosis can be just like that. Nothing you need to do, just drifting from
        one thought to another, from one awareness to another.</p>
    </div>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2">8.2.3 Narrowly Focused Attention</i></h4>

    <p class="noindent">It may seem contradictory since the previous aspect of inducing an altered state was defocused
      attention, but narrowly focusing attention is another doorway into trance. This is akin to listening to a riveting
      speaker or lecturer, or being very absorbed in a suspenseful novel or movie. When attention narrows, trance can
      ensue. Classical hypnotists sometimes have people gaze at a specific spot on a wall to narrow attention, but in
      our approach we are not so directive. We can, however, invite people to this kind of attention by reminding them
      or by speaking about something that captures their attention.</p>

    <div class="extr">
      <p class="indent"><b class="calibre6">Hypnotherapist:</b> Sometimes when I listen to music, I become very focused
        on picking out one of the instruments in the piece, say the bass or the piccolo, and I just follow it through
        the whole song. Later, I realize that I have been in a <a id="calibre_link-249" class="calibre1"></a>kind of a
        trance. You can go back to a similar experience for you and get that sense of focus to continue to go into
        trance in a way that’s right for you.</p>
    </div>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2">8.2.4 Dissociation</i></h4>

    <p class="noindent">Disssociation involves inviting people to experience themselves as divided in some way, often
      getting the sense that some part of them is acting independently. This often happens spontaneously, but can be
      invited.</p>

    <div class="extr">
      <p class="indent"><b class="calibre6">Hypnotherapist:</b> One part of you can listen to what I am saying and one
        part of you can drift away. My teacher, Dr. Erick-son, used to put people in trance and then instruct them to
        recall the humor of their favorite joke but not the content of the joke. This had the effect of teaching the
        person that they could access any emotion as it was needed without getting all wrapped up in the content.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="extr">
      <p class="indent"><b class="calibre6">Hypnotherapist:</b> One time when I was doing a demonstration of hypnosis in
        Finland, I asked for four volunteers who understood and spoke English very well to come up to be part of the
        demonstration. During the trance, I invited people to come out of trance from the neck up and stay in trance
        from the neck down. After that, I invited them all to experience hand levitation. Later one of the demonstration
        subjects told me that she realized during the trance that she could no longer understand English but that her
        body still could. She said that when I had invited the hand levitation, she couldn’t understand what I was
        saying and had to wait for the Finnish translation that was being provided. But her hand began to twitch and
        move even before she heard the translation, so she knew that her body could still understand English even though
        her mind couldn’t. <a id="calibre_link-250" class="calibre1"></a>There are parts of you that can understand
        things that other parts don’t.</p>

      <p class="indent">These four factors can be used to induce or invite people into any kind of altered state&mdash;I
        believe they are universal. When used in an interpersonal therapeutic setting, these aspects of altered state
        induction can be used to create a hypnotic altered state or trance.</p>

    <h3 class="chaptita"><a id="calibre_link-251" class="calibre1"></a><b class="calibre6"><a href="#calibre_link-17"
          id="calibre_link-63" class="calibre1">8.3 Why Use Trance?</a></b></h3>

    <p class="noindent">Now let’s take up another of the overviews of trance. Why use trance in the first place? Why not
      just use standard therapy or change methods? The simple answer is that trance can complement usual therapy
      procedures and methods and can sometimes produce results that those standard methods don’t.</p>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000054.jpg" class="calibre49" /></p>

    <p class="indent">What trance is especially good for is influencing and changing automatic experiences, that is,
      those that are not so readily controlled or created by the person’s conscious, willful efforts.</p>

    <p class="indent">For example, if someone came to me for treatment of migraine headaches, I would be inclined to use
      hypnosis. Of course, a therapist might use stress reduction methods or some other method that relies on the
      deliberate efforts of the person, but in my experience, hypnosis can be much more effective in a shorter time than
      standard therapy methods for this kind of problem, and sometimes it is the only effective method.</p>

    <p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-252" class="calibre1"></a>Hypnosis is very good at changing automatic symptoms
      and problems because it is good at evoking automatic (nonconscious) changes. In the next section, we’ll discuss
      how to decide when to use hypnosis and expand on this point.</p>

    <h3 class="chaptita"><a id="calibre_link-253" class="calibre1"></a><b class="calibre6"><a href="#calibre_link-18"
          id="calibre_link-64" class="calibre1">8.4 When to Use Hypnosis</a></b></h3>

    <p class="noindent">One time while I was teaching a seminar on hypnosis, someone asked me when in a therapy session
      I knew I would be using hypnosis with the person. I answered without hesitation: “In the first session; often
      within the first half of the first session.” When trying to explain how I knew so quickly, I discovered that I had
      a simple criterion for when I use hypnosis and when I don’t.</p>

    <p class="indent">I use hypnosis for nonvoluntary symptoms and problems; that is, those problems that the person
      cannot produce upon demand. And I don’t use hypnosis for problems that can be changed by deliberate efforts,
      activities, and changes within the person’s conscious control.</p>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000072.jpg" class="calibre50" /></p>

    <p class="indent">Of course, there is a problem with this simple criterion: many problems can be viewed as a mix of
      voluntary and nonvoluntary elements. But most problems are primarily one or the other, so in practice, it is
      relatively easy for me to decide. And my decision is influenced by how much effort the person (or others, such as
      medical practitioners) has spent unsuccessfully to treat the problem before he or she came to see me for help. If
      someone has tried many ways to free himself from panic attacks, such as taking medication, applying methods of
      cognitive-behavioral therapy, reading self-help books on the subject, and so on, I will be more inclined <a
        id="calibre_link-254" class="calibre1"></a>to use hypnosis. Why? Because reasonable methods of voluntary
      activity haven’t helped.</p>

    <p class="indent">One could, of course, use a combination of hypnosis and other methods, since many problems are a
      combination of voluntary and nonvoluntary elements, and that’s what I often do. I often use a combination of
      hypnotic and nonhypnotic interventions.</p>

    <p class="indent">Let’s examine a few common presenting problems for therapists and whether they are voluntary,
      nonvoluntary, or some combination of both.</p>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2">8.4.1 Panic Attacks</i></h4>

    <p class="noindent">Panic attacks are typically nonvoluntary, since the feelings and sensations of panic usually
      arise without people’s conscious awareness and, despite their best deliberate efforts, they cannot stop or control
      the panicked feelings or sensations. Good for trance work.</p>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2">8.4.2 Smoking</i></h4>

    <p class="noindent">Smoking has a combination of voluntary (buying or borrowing cigarettes, picking up a cigarette
      and putting it in one’s mouth, lighting it up, inhaling) and nonvoluntary (craving nicotine, relaxed feelings
      after taking a puff) elements. Thus, one might intervene with a combination of hypnosis and nonhypnotic methods.
    </p>

    <p class="indent">At a workshop on hypnosis, I happened to mention that the long-term success of hypnosis with
      smoking cessation was only about 20&ndash;25%. During a break, a participant in the workshop told me that he was
      achieving a greater than 90% success rate using hypnosis with smokers. I asked him to describe his method, so I
      could try it out. He told me that he advertised in <a id="calibre_link-255" class="calibre1"></a>the newspaper for
      hypnotic treatment to help people stop smoking. When people called, he told them they must prove to him that they
      were motivated to stop smoking. They could do that by not smoking for three days and then calling him. He offered
      an appointment for them the very next day. I was amused by this method, since it was obvious to me, but not to
      him, that he was using a very powerful voluntary intervention for smoking cessation. Anyone who was willing and
      able to go three days without a cigarette was through the first part of major withdrawal. Then using hypnosis to
      support them through the next part of smoking cessation became much more successful. He had also weeded out most
      smokers and therefore worked with a highly select and motivated group. I thought it was somewhat akin to asking
      people to stop being depressed for three days and then accepting them into treatment for depression.</p>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000002.jpg" class="calibre51" /></p>

    <p class="indent">Voluntary interventions for smokers could involve getting them to wait longer and longer between
      each cigarette; they could involve holding the cigarette between any other fingers than usual and on the hand in
      which the smoker didn’t usually hold the cigarette; they could involve writing a letter, or making a phone call,
      or doing some exercise one had been putting off before the next cigarette.</p>

    <p class="indent">Nonvoluntary (hypnotic) interventions for smoking could involve changes in muscle tension (since
      people often smoke to relax or relieve tension); changes in blood vessel dilation (since nicotine helps blood
      vessels dilate, and therefore provides physiological relaxation); changes in cravings (probably related to brain
      and cell chemistry that are implicated in the addictive side of smoking); and so on.</p>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2"><a id="calibre_link-256" class="calibre1"></a>8.4.3 Insomnia</i></h4>

    <p class="noindent">Again, insomnia is a good subject for trance because it is mainly nonvoluntary. People have
      typically already tried to make themselves go to sleep and it hasn’t worked.</p>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2">8.4.4 Dissociation</i></h4>

    <p class="noindent">Another good problem for trance is dissociation, since it usually occurs without a person’s
      conscious intention. It feels automatic to most people when it happens. They either don’t even notice that it is
      happening or has happened, or they notice it but can’t control it. They just space out or feel detached.</p>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2">8.4.5 Depression</i></h4>

    <p class="noindent">Depression is usually a combination of actions and nonvoluntary experience. People often
      withdraw from social connections before or as they begin feeling depressed. They often begin to think in certain
      ways that support depression. They usually become less physically active. They often focus on their failings or
      bad things that have happened in the past or could happen in the future. These are all things that they might be
      able to influence by shifting their thinking, attention, or actions.</p>

    <p class="indent">The nonvoluntary aspects of depression, often treated with medications, are more amenable to
      hypnotic intervention. These include brain chemical levels and energy levels. Some people are not helped by
      medications or only helped a bit, and hypnosis can be a good adjunct or alternative treatment.</p>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000017.jpg" class="calibre52" /></p>

    </h3>

    <p class="noindent">When people go into trance, they regularly have alterations in the areas of perceptions, memory,
      sensations, physiology, and their sense of time and space, among other changes. These sometimes occur
      spontaneously and can also be evoked or invited by the hypnotist.</p>

    <p class="indent">In this section we’ll go over the list of the most common of these alterations, usually referred
      to as trance phenomena or hypnotic phenomena. I’ll also discuss how to evoke or invite people to experience them
      during trance.</p>

    <p class="indent1">What are trance phenomena good for?</p>

    <p class="hanging1">• They convince the person and you that the person is in trance.</p>

    <p class="hanging1">• They usually deepen the person’s involvement in the trance experience.</p>

    <p class="hanging2">• They are also used as treatments (we’ll discuss this more in a later section).</p>

    <p class="indent">While trance phenomena can be dramatic, they can also be seen as exaggerated forms of things that
      occur in less dramatic ways in everyday life. For example, if you work in a hospital, after some time you don’t
      smell the “hospital smell” that is ever-present for visitors. This is an everyday example of the trance phenomenon
      called <i class="calibre2">negative hallucination</i>, that is, not perceiving <a id="calibre_link-259"
        class="calibre1"></a>something that is present in one’s sensory experience. Similarly, you might sometimes hear
      someone calling your name on a crowded street and find that you had imagined it. This is an everyday example of
      what hypnotists call <i class="calibre2">positive hallucination</i>.</p>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000034.jpg" class="calibre53" /></p>

    <p class="indent">You can think of trance in two ways, then. One is that it acts like a magnifying glass for
      everyday experiences, making them more dramatic. The other analogy I use is that trance allows you to get your
      hands on the control knob of automatic experiences. It’s a bit like those light switches that allow you to dim or
      brighten a light by turning a knob. Trance allows you to turn the intensity down or up on some parts of experience
      (again, sensations, perceptions, memory, the automatic parts of physiology, or perceptions of time and space). For
      example, turning the knob up on memory could create what is called <i
        class="calibre2">hypermnesia</i>&mdash;remembering things vividly&mdash;while turning down the memory knob could
      create amnesia&mdash;forgetting.</p>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000049.jpg" class="calibre54" /></p>

    <p class="indent1">If I suggested to you (in your everyday state of consciousness) that you could experience
      yourself as being on the other side of the room, you probably wouldn’t be able to do that. But if you are in
      trance and you are invited to that altered sense of the location of your body, you would be more likely to
      experience it. Trance can make our inner experiences more plastic, more malleable.</p>

    <p class="indent">What follows is a list of the kinds of areas and changes that can be evoked in the trance state.

          Phenomena</a></b></h3>

    <p class="noindent">I will remind you here that you are not adding anything from the outside when you invite people
      to experience these experiential changes we call <i class="calibre2">trance phenomena</i> (or sometimes <i
        class="calibre2">hypnotic phenomena</i>).</p>

    <p class="indent">These trance phenomena already exist within people as potentials and are evoked by the
      interactions between hypnotist and client. After many years of doing hypnosis, I still find these manifestations
      of people’s ability to shift their inner experience fascinating. As you witness them, I suspect you will feel the
      same.</p>

    <p class="indent">In this section, you will learn five ways to evoke trance phenomena.</p>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2">8.6.1 Giving Permission</i></h4>

    <p class="noindent">The first way to evoke trance phenomena is to give permission for them to happen, or for a
      specific one to happen. Often this is all people need to begin the process of evoking automatic changes (or even
      less than that, at times, since they will happen spontaneously without you mentioning or inviting them).</p>

    <p class="indent">You use the same permissive methods we discussed in the first part of the book when inducing
      trance. Remember the two types of permission: <i class="calibre2">Permission to</i> and <i
        class="calibre2">permission not to have to</i>. I will illustrate these in the examples below.</p>

    <div class="extr">
      <p class="indent"><b class="calibre6">Hypnotherapist:</b> Your hand and arm can start to lift up a little at a
        time without you lifting it.</p>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000063.jpg" class="calibre59" /></p>

    <p class="indentt"><b class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-265" class="calibre1"></a>Hypnotherapist:</b> Time can
      change. It might become more stretched out, or it might become more condensed, or you could just lose track of
      time altogether.</p>

    <div class="extr">
      <p class="indent"><b class="calibre6">Hypnotherapist:</b> You could notice that you are starting to become numb in
        some places in your body.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="extr">
      <p class="indent"><b class="calibre6">Hypnotherapist:</b> You don’t have to hear anything that isn’t relevant for
        you.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000079.jpg" class="calibre60" /></p>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2">8.6.2 Presupposing Response</i></h4>

    <p class="noindent">Evoking trance phenomena by presupposing a response uses the same method we discussed earlier in
      <a href="#calibre_link-21" class="calibre1">Chapter 2</a>, but this time it is used specifically to evoke the
      automatic sensory, perceptual, and physiological changes that constitute the trance phenomena.
    </p>

    <div class="extr">
      <p class="indent"><b class="calibre6">Hypnotherapist:</b> How quickly will one of those hands lift up?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="extr">
      <p class="indent"><b class="calibre6">Hypnotherapist:</b> Which one will lift up first?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="extr">
      <p class="indent"><b class="calibre6">Hypnotherapist:</b> What will you notice first that will let you know which
        hand is going to lift up?</p>

    <div class="extr">
      <p class="indent"><b class="calibre6">Hypnotherapist:</b> How relaxed will you become? I really don’t know.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="extr">
      <p class="indent"><b class="calibre6">Hypnotherapist:</b> When will you start to experience that numbness? Your
        unconscious will decide and let us both know in the appropriate time and way.</p>
    </div>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2"><a id="calibre_link-266" class="calibre1"></a>8.6.3 Reminding and Guiding
        Associations to Previous Everyday Experience</i></h4>

    <p class="noindent">It can be helpful to remind people of previous experiences similar to trance phenomena they have
      had in their lives. This reminder may serve as a mini evocation and lead to more pronounced trance phenomena.</p>

    <div class="extr">
      <p class="indent"><b class="calibre6">Hypnotherapist:</b> Perhaps you can recall driving down the highway on a
        long trip; time just disappeared.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="extr">
      <p class="indent"><b class="calibre6">Hypnotherapist:</b> When the dentist gave you Novocain, you experienced that
        numbness. Your body and your unconscious mind can remember that physiologically and experientially and create a
        similar kind of numbness where you need it now.</p>
    </div>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2">8.6.4 Analogies, Anecdotes, and Stories</i></h4>

    <p class="noindent">Using analogies, anecdotes, and stories is a complex skill and we will take it up in a future
      section as well, but in this approach, we use many stories as a method for inviting change and for evoking
      automatic changes while the person is in trance. In the <a id="calibre_link-267" class="calibre1"></a>examples
      that follow, I will add some commentary in italics in the stories to highlight where I am evoking trance
      phenomena.</p>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000008.jpg" class="calibre61" /></p>

    <div class="extr">
      <p class="indent"><b class="calibre6">Hypnotherapist:</b> When I was a child, I couldn’t wait to get out of school
        at the end of the day. During the last half hour (school let out at 3 in the afternoon), I was a boy divided [<i
          class="calibre2">this is an invitation to dissociation</i>]. One part of my attention was on the clock on the
        front wall of the classroom; one part of my attention was on the teacher and what she was saying (the penalties
        were harsh for not attending in my school); and one part of me was already imagining what fun I would have after
        I was out of this building.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000023.jpg" class="calibre62" /></p>

    <p class="indent">The problem was that the type of industrial clocks we had in our classrooms had a tendency to have
      the hands stick and stay in place [<i class="calibre2">this is an invitation to immobility of the hands</i>]. It
      seemed like it would be 2:33 for 15 minutes [<i class="calibre2">this is an invitation to time distortion</i>].
      That hand just wouldn’t move. Finally it would jump up and move 2 or 3 minutes at a time [<i class="calibre2">this
        is an invitation to hand levitation</i>].</p>

    <div class="extr">
      <p class="indent"><b class="calibre6">Hypnotherapist:</b> I was on an airplane coming back to the United States
        from Australia a few years ago. When we crossed the International Date Line, the captain came on the intercom
        and announced, “In 2 minutes, it will be yesterday.” That made <a id="calibre_link-268" class="calibre1"></a>me
        realize that clock and calendar time can be different from subjective time. You can change time inside so that
        you have enough time to sort out everything that needs to be sorted out. And you can transport yourself to any
        time you need to visit, the past or the future, to resolve what needs to be resolved.</p>
    </div>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2">8.6.5 Interspersed Phrases</i></h4>

    <p class="noindent">Again, we have covered the use of interspersed phrases in an earlier section, but not the
      application of the method to evoke trance phenomena. As a reminder, interspersal involves emphasizing certain
      phrases and words nonverbally to evoke a non-conscious response. The bold phrases and words in the following
      examples relate to trance phenomena.</p>

    <p class="indentt">(To evoke hand and arm levitation to the face)</p>

        Result?</a></p>

    <p class="noindent">How I wish someone had answered this $64,000 question for me during my training in hypnosis and
      hypnotherapy. I learned a lot about getting a person into trance, handling abreactions, and giving suggestions,
      but little about the actual nitty-gritty of facilitating change with hypnotherapy if simple suggestion did not
      produce results (it often doesn’t, in my experience).</p>

    <p class="indentt">So here, for much less than $64,000, is my answer.</p>

    <h3 class="chaptita"><a id="calibre_link-271" class="calibre1"></a><b class="calibre6"><a href="#calibre_link-89"
          id="calibre_link-68" class="calibre1">9.1 Goals of Traditional Versus Solution-Oriented Hypnosis</a></b></h3>

    <p class="noindent">In the solution-oriented approach to hypnotherapy, the goals of treatment are substantially
      different from traditional hypnotherapeutic (or even nonhypnotic therapy) approaches.</p>

    <p class="indent">Traditional hypnotherapy tries to find sources or causes of problems through hypnosis. Since
      hypnosis is thought to directly access repressed unconscious knowledge or information, it is used to discover or
      uncover hidden, nonobvious causes, traumas, or early life decisions (such as “I will never trust anyone” or “I
      have to be quiet or I will be hurt”) for current problems.</p>

    <p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-272" class="calibre1"></a>Embedded in this traditional approach is another
      idea: that people are flawed and pathological due to some personality, emotional, neurological, or trauma-based
      problems or deficits. Hypnotherapy is designed to correct or compensate for these problems or deficits.</p>

    <p class="indent">Ericksonian or solution-oriented hypnosis holds no such assumption of pathology, problem, damage,
      or deficit. Instead, we are oriented to people’s abilities and resources. Therefore, we use the hypnotic process
      to discover and connect to resources.</p>

    <p class="indent">Another difference is in the time orientation of the solution-oriented approach versus the
      traditional. We are oriented more to the present and future in this approach, whereas traditional approaches are
      more oriented to the past and its relationship to the present.</p>

    <p class="indent">Of course, sometimes in the trances that occur in this approach, people do uncover or discover
      some previously unknown or unacknowledged information related to their problems, but the hypnotherapist does not
      guide people to the past in order to discover these things.</p>

    <p class="indent">The rest of this chapter will show, in more specific ways, how we implement this different
      orientation in hypnotherapy.</p>

    <h3 class="chaptita"><a id="calibre_link-273" class="calibre1"></a><b class="calibre6"><a href="#calibre_link-90"
          id="calibre_link-69" class="calibre1">9.2 Class of Problems and Class of Solutions Model</a></b></h3>

    <p class="noindent">Erickson could be a mystery to those who studied his work. He seemed to be endlessly creative in
      his clinical work, rarely using the same approach to the same problem, even when he had been successful with that
      approach in previous cases. He approached every person as a unique individual and delighted in creating a
      particular intervention for that person or clinical situation.</p>

    <p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-274" class="calibre1"></a>Most therapists do not operate in this way. We learn
      theories and a set of interventions we try to personalize, but we generally do not make up a whole new approach
      for each person.</p>

    <p class="indent">But there was a pattern to Erickson’s interventions. One must look deeper to find it. I have
      created a model that has helped me and others to understand how Erickson generated new interventions for each
      person and that has helped those who have used the model to do the same for their clients and patients. I call
      this model the class of problems and class of solutions model. I had a flash of insight one day while reading
      about a case of Erickson’s. He wasn’t focused on working on the specific presenting problem directly (he is often
      referred to as an indirect hypnotherapist). Instead he seemed to move to another level and abstract the kind or
      type of problem that included the particular problem. This gave him a lot of options for intervention and ensured
      that he wouldn’t have to repeat himself.</p>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000073.jpg" class="calibre65" /></p>

    <p class="indent">For example, if the presenting problem was impotence, one class of problems to which it could
      belong is “lack of blood flow.” Now, you may notice I wrote “to which it could belong,” and this indicates
      something that allows for even more flexibility. There is not necessarily one class of problems. That is, the
      particular problem must fit with the class, but there may be multiple classes to which the problem could belong.
      In the case of impotence, the class of problems might be anxiety or performance anxiety. Or it could be low levels
      of sex hormones. Or it could be relationship problems.</p>

    <p class="indent">Whatever class of problems you determine would fit, the next step is to come up with a class of
      solutions that could <a id="calibre_link-275" class="calibre1"></a>potentially resolve that problem. This is where
      this Ericksonian or solution-oriented approach really differs from traditional hypnotherapy. In this approach, we
      search for resources (in the automatic realm) that could be used to shift the problem. We are not searching for
      past traumas or decisions that created the problem. We are not looking for underlying, hidden motivations or
      issues that are not obvious to the client or patient. We are simply focused on the presenting complaint and
      marshaling the resources needed to resolve or shift it.</p>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000019.jpg" class="calibre66" /></p>

    <p class="indent">What follows is a detailed set of instructions for implementing the class of problems and class of
      solutions model in hypnotherapy settings. One could use it in nonhypnotic settings, of course, but then the focus
      would not typically be on evoking automatic or nonconscious resources and abilities. One could also use it in
      nontherapy settings, but that is far beyond the scope of this book.</p>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2"><a id="calibre_link-276" class="calibre1"></a>9.2.1 Determine the Focus
        for the Hypnotic Intervention</i></h4>

    <p class="noindent">Obviously, for this model to lend itself to hypnosis, the problem must be cast in terms of an
      automatic process. For that to happen, one has to get a clear, specific problem to focus upon. Some therapists are
      used to being more vague about the goals of hypnosis or therapy. Not here. No “working through emotional issues”
      or “uncovering insights into self-sabotaging.” These problems are more like “migraine headaches,” or “panic
      attacks.” If you can’t get specific or if focusing on specific presenting problems is anathema to you, this model
      will not serve you well. There is a relatively easy way to determine the focus for treatment in most cases: pay
      attention to what people are complaining about when they seek treatment, and use that as the focus. Unless people
      have been well trained by previous therapists, they rarely arrive in treatment asking for help with their
      unresolved oedipal conflicts, uncathected emotions, a wounded inner child, or even traumas. They mention specific
      problems that are bringing suffering to their lives: insomnia, flashbacks to traumatic events, depressed feelings,
      chronic pain in some part of their body, impotence or lack of sexual desire, an unreasonable fear of something
      that limits them in their lives, and so on. It is one of these specific complaints that we use as a starting point
      for this model. Stay close to the presenting complaint or problem when devising an intervention using this model.

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2"><a id="calibre_link-277" class="calibre1"></a>9.2.2 Turn Problems Into
        Processes</i></h4>

    <p class="noindent">To get this model to work, one must then turn the problem into a process. It must have aspects
      that are open to change. Sometimes this means there is a sequence of things that happen automatically that we
      could intervene in. Sometimes this means that we are merely casting the problem as something that gets re-created
      again and again; thus it is open to change by getting something else to happen instead.</p>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000052.jpg" class="calibre68" /></p>

    <p class="indent">For example, a migraine headache can be viewed as having a number of elements that might lend
      themselves to intervention and change. Some blood vessels dilate and some contract. There is a change in blood
      chemistry. Muscles tense in certain parts of the body. Ears often become more sensitive to sounds; eyes become
      more sensitive to light. There are often sensations or visual distortions that precede the development of a
      migraine (so-called prodromal symptoms). Interventions (derived from classes of solutions) could be targeted at
      any of these aspects of the process or pattern of the migraine.</p>

    <p class="indent">Don’t think of the problem as a thing, but as a set of internal actions (mostly automatic and
      outside the person’s conscious control or even awareness, of course; that is why we are using trance). Choose one
      or more of those actions and intervene in them to discover if trance can make a positive difference.</p>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2"><a id="calibre_link-278" class="calibre1"></a>9.2.3 How Does the Person
        (or Body) Do This Problem</i>?</h4>

    <p class="noindent">One of the ways to get to the process description is to ask yourself: If I had control over this
      person’s physical, physiological, sensory, or emotional systems, how would I create this problem? For example, one
      could create a good panic attack by increasing the person’s heart rate, and creating sweaty palms, racing
      thoughts, and images or thoughts of terrible things like heart attacks or bad things happening to people or their
      loved ones. Each of these things can be mapped onto the class of problems and class of solutions template.</p>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000069.jpg" class="calibre69" /></p>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2"><a id="calibre_link-279" class="calibre1"></a>9.2.4 What Class of Problem
        Could It Belong To</i>?</h4>

    <p class="noindent">From the description of process, one can derive a class of problems to which a particular
      problem could belong. Using the panic attack example above, one class of problem could be increased heart rate.
    </p>

    <p class="indent">For a person who has been having extramarital affairs, the class of problems could be being
      impulsive. For someone who suffers from a hair-trigger temper, the class of problems could be “letting feelings
      cause one’s actions.” Any class of problem that you can derive from the specific problem at hand will work (as
      long as you have an idea of its opposite and that it can be changed by hypnosis).</p>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2">9.2.5 What Is an Opposite Class That Could Solve It</i>?</h4>

    <p class="noindent">The next step is to think of the opposite of the class of problems: some resource, skill,
      pattern of experience, and so forth that could undo the problem. In the example of panic attacks and increased
      heart rate, the opposite could be decreased or slower heart rate.</p>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000085.jpg" class="calibre70" /></p>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2"><a id="calibre_link-280" class="calibre1"></a>9.2.6 What Anecdote,
        Analogy, Trance Phenomenon, Task Assignment, or Interpersonal Move Could Evoke the Resource</i>?</h4>

    <p class="noindent">The next step is to do some intervention that could access or evoke the resource, skill, or
      pattern of experience that fits with the class of solution. Again, following the above example of decreased heart
      rate to help stop or reduce panic attacks, you could tell a story about someone who had a reduced heart rate, or
      use an analogy of turning down the intensity of a light with a dimmer switch, or evoke reduced heart rate as a
      trance phenomenon. Causing someone to blush due to something you said is an example of an interpersonal move
      evoking the resource.</p>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000014.jpg" class="calibre71" /></p>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2">9.2.7 Transfer the Evoked Ability or Resource to the Problem Area</i></h4>

    <p class="noindent">Transferring evoked resources to the problem is commonly called posthypnotic suggestion, but
      since I deemphasize the suggestive aspect of hypnosis, let’s just call it “linking the evoked resource to the
      problem area.” In essence, what I am suggesting here is that you make some sort of verbal linkage between the
      ability, skill, pattern of experience, or resource that has been evoked through the intervention (a story, an
      analogy, a trance phenomenon, an interpersonal move, or a task assignment) and the potential recurrence of the
      problem.</p>

          or Not; That is the Question</a></b></h3>

    <p class="noindent">Dr. Erickson was fond of saying, “Trust your unconscious. It knows more than you do.” Erickson
      held the view that the unconscious was a repository of skills, abilities, and resources. He had a rather positive
      view compared to Freud’s view of the unconscious as a cauldron of repressed and primitive urges that needed the
      ego and superego to keep it in check, or we would all be Mr. Hydes running around being violent and acting out our
      selfish needs.</p>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000047.jpg" class="calibre73" /></p>

    <p class="indent">Having been influenced by Erickson, I subscribed to this more benevolent, resourceful view of the
      unconscious for years. But several things got me to rethink it. First, my good friend and fellow Erickson student,
      Stephen Gilligan, once gave a session at one of the Erickson conferences titled <i class="calibre2">If the
        Unconscious Is So Smart, Why Do People Have Problems or Symptoms</i>? I thought that was a very good question
      and it got me thinking.</p>

    <p class="indent">Some time later, Joe Barber, another colleague, was ranting during our lunch at one of the
      Erickson conferences, “These Ericksonians are driving me mad running around saying ‘Trust your unconscious’! Don’t
      they know the unconscious is dumb, dumb, dumb?”</p>

    <p class="indent">I considered this dilemma for some years and finally came to a conclusion as to what my view on
      the matter was. Here’s my answer:</p>

    <div class="extr">
      <p class="extract1"><a id="calibre_link-284" class="calibre1"></a>The unconscious is smart about what it is smart
        about, dumb about what it is dumb about and smart about, some things it’s dumb to be smart about.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="indent1">Lest you think I’m just being a smart aleck or trying to use Erickson’s confusion technique on
      you, let me explain.</p>

    <p class="indent">Let’s say you have mastered the sport of tennis. For some time, you’ve been playing tennis, taking
      lessons, practicing your swings, your serves, and so on. You’re getting pretty good at it. At a certain point,
      your muscles begin to learn tennis and you don’t have to think about it. In fact, you find that if you think about
      it, you play more poorly. One way to talk about this is to say that your unconscious is smart about playing
      tennis. You could go out on the court and trust your unconscious, since it knows a lot and has it encoded
      automatically.</p>

    <p class="indent">I play guitar and I am pretty good at it. I could give a professional talk, watch television, or
      read a book and play quite complex things on a guitar at the same time. My fingers know the patterns and I don’t
      have to give it much conscious attention. My unconscious is smart about playing guitar.</p>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000064.jpg" class="calibre74" /></p>

    <p class="indent">So, if your unconscious is smart about something, trust your unconscious. But there are some
      things you shouldn’t trust your unconscious about, because your unconscious is dumb about those things. If you
      don’t know touch typing, look at the keys; otherwise your typing will come out like gobbledygook. Your unconscious
      is dumb about touch typing. I couldn’t read a book or give a lecture while I played the mandolin. My unconscious
      is dumb about playing the mandolin.</p>

    <p class="centerimg"><a id="calibre_link-285" class="calibre1"></a><img alt="" src="images/000080.jpg"
        class="calibre75" /></p>

    <p class="indent">Now here’s where it gets interesting, especially for hypnotherapy. Sometimes your unconscious is
      smart about things it is dumb to be smart about. We know the brain gets grooved in patterns after repeating some
      experiences. (“Neurons that fire together wire together” is the neurologist’s phrase for this). Throughout our
      lives we sometimes develop unconscious or automatic patterns that no longer serve, or aren’t flexible enough to
      function well, in our current environments.</p>

    <p class="indent">For example, say someone was sexually abused regularly when she was younger. She used a handy
      coping mechanism, dissociation, when she was overwhelmed with the emotions or sensations during the sexual abuse.
      One of my clients told me she would go into a painting hanging on the wall of her bedroom during her abuse.</p>

    <p class="indent">But that person grows up, moves on a bit, and meets someone she loves and would like to be close
      to. She might discover that each time her partner approaches her sexually or even with affectionate touch, without
      her conscious intention, she dissociates. Her unconscious is smart about dissociating but in this context it is
      dumb to be smart about that.</p>

    <p class="indent">That leads to one of the things that hypnosis can contribute to therapy, and this is the heart of
      the matter. Through hypnosis, <a id="calibre_link-286" class="calibre1"></a>we can get access to the nonconscious
      or automatic patterns the unconscious is smart about and rearrange the wiring. We can undo previous associations
      and automatic patterns and encourage new associations and patterns.</p>

    <p class="indent">Sometimes I think of hypnosis as a way to get back to potentials and what the Zen practitioners
      call “the beginner’s mind.” It is a chance to start again and update with new flexibilities that can be responsive
      to current and future realities.</p>

    <p class="indent">So, to conclude this little but all-important section, trust your unconscious when it is smart
      about something that works for you in your current life and reality; don’t trust your unconscious if it is not
      smart or automatically skilled in that area; and don’t trust your unconscious if what your unconscious mind is
      smart about and has on automatic pilot is not serving you well or is creating suffering in your current
      circumstances.</p>

    <p class="indent">See, that was clear enough, huh? Or clearly confusing if you didn’t follow it. If I lost you, go
      back and read this section again. It is clear, I promise, and it is important for you to understand it in order to
      use what follows.</p>

          to Do Hypnotherapy</a></b></h3>

    <p class="noindent">How can you use the ideas I have discussed to do hypnotherapy? Two ways: Identify the unwanted
      or unhelpful automatic patterns that are leading to problems; and then introduce changes by splitting and linking,
      akin to rewiring people’s experiential lives. Let’s discuss these two ways in more detail.</p>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2">9.4.1 Find the Place Where Automatic Patterns Occur and Lead to Unwanted
        Results</i></h4>

    <p class="noindent">Automatic patterns with bad results is the place where the unconscious is smart about things
      it’s dumb to be smart about. The unconscious has gotten skilled at creating, for example, migraine headaches or
      panic attacks.</p>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000024.jpg" class="calibre77" /></p>

    <p class="indent">So, your task is to identify the patterns and processes that are occurring automatically and
      leading to problems and then intervene. How do you intervene? By using splitting and linking. Remember, we used
      these skills to create trance; now we are using them to create therapeutic change.</p>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2">9.4.2 Introduce Changes Into the Automatic Pattern by Splitting and
        Linking</i></h4>

    <p class="noindent">I sometimes think of the process of introducing changes as doing plumbing or rewiring on an old
      house. I come to my client’s “house” (the inner life) and discover that some of the old wiring is creating leaks,
      flooding, power outages, or surges. My job is to rearrange things so that they are “up to code”&mdash;that is, so
      they work well now and in the future.</p>

    <p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-289" class="calibre1"></a>For example, seeing needles no longer needs to be
      connected with fear or tense muscles. It can be connected to being healthy, feeling calm, or just watching the
      needle with no emotional reaction. It has been wired to fear or tense muscles, but hypnosis is an opportunity to
      rewire, and to rewire without the person having to make any deliberate efforts.</p>

    <p class="indent">How do we accomplish this rewiring? The ways we have discussed above: evoking abilities or
      experiences and linking them to other experiences or cues. New associations can be created through trance using
      stories, permissive suggestions, interspersal, analogies, or trance phenomena.</p>

    <p class="indent">As a reminder, here is a chart that summarizes typical ways to evoke automatic responses through
      trance.</p>

    </h4>

    <p class="noindent">Imagine that you were putting on a play and had to populate the stage with items and sets that
      would evoke the scenes you were trying to get people to envision. Since you can’t put everything on stage (it
      would be too crowded or expensive), you would have to choose some key items that would be most evocative, say a
      couch here, a telephone there, and so on. Stories are similar. Since you don’t have all the time in the world
      (people would get bored with too much description of setting and props), you must be careful to put in just enough
      and not too much. This balance usually comes with practice.</p>

          id="calibre_link-72" class="calibre1">9.5 Stories in Trance Work</a></b></h3>

    <p class="noindent">One way to evoke classes of solutions and resources is to tell stories. I discussed stories a
      bit earlier, but here I would like to go into more detail. I write stories for a living that are interspersed in
      my books, and I tell stories in my workshops and seminars, so I have been thinking about what makes an engaging,
      effective story for some time.</p>

    <p class="indent">Here is my quick guide to elements of effective, engaging stories. Mastering the art of
      storytelling can make your hypnotherapy more successful.</p>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2">9.5.1 Elements of Stories</i></h4>

    <p class="noindent">Some key aspects of the Ericksonian approach are storytelling in therapy and trancework.</p>

    <p class="indent">I was not a natural or comfortable storyteller and had to deliberately learn and practice
      storytelling. To make this skill more available to you, I will detail some of the elements of effective
      storytelling.</p>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2"><a id="calibre_link-292" class="calibre1"></a>9.5.2 Characters</i></h4>

    <p class="noindent">Part of what hooks us into stories is that they have characters (often people, but sometimes
      animals or inanimate objects we bring to life) with whom we can identify. These characters can evoke empathy and
      emotions in us when we imagine ourselves as them.</p>

    <p class="indent">So, ensure that there are characters in the stories you tell during trance.</p>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2">9.5.3 Action</i></h4>

    <p class="noindent">What makes a story different from an analogy is that something happens during a story while an
      analogy is merely a static description.</p>

    <p class="indent">Years ago, during a therapy session in which the mother in the family we were seeing literally
      would not stop talking, my cotherapist said to our primary client, “Your mother has a freeway mouth with no
      on-ramp.” That image is an analogy. His point was that, since no one in the session could get a word in edgewise
      due to the mother’s non-stop talking, she was like a highway which nobody could get on.</p>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000058.jpg" class="calibre79" /></p>

    <p class="indent">To turn it into a story, he might have said, “I live in Casa Grande and one day, when I went to
      get onto the freeway to go to Tempe, I found the only freeway on-ramp was closed for repair. I was stumped and sat
      in my car by the closed entrance for some time pondering my dilemma. How was I to get to Tempe? Finally I realized
      that there must have been a way to get there from Casa Grande before the freeway was built, so I looked on a map I
      had in the car and found another route, which actually turned out to be very scenic and interesting, although it
      did take a bit longer.”</p>

    <p class="indent"><a id="calibre_link-293" class="calibre1"></a>Now this is a story since something happened in it.
    </p>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2">9.5.4 Beginnings, Middles, and Ends</i></h4>

    <p class="noindent">One of the things that happened in the story above is that it had a beginning (he went to the
      freeway and couldn’t get on); a middle (he sat in his car and was stumped); and an ending (he had a realization,
      then consulted a map and found another way to Tempe).</p>

    <p class="indent">Some people who aren’t good joke tellers or storytellers often leave out one of these crucial
      elements, and the story falls apart or becomes less compelling.</p>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2">9.5.5 Dialogue</i></h4>

    <p class="noindent">Including exact wording and quotations is another way to bring stories alive. If you merely
      describe what went on (they yelled at each other for a while), it is typically less compelling than giving
      actually dialogue (“I’ll never trust you again,” she said. “You won’t have to because I am leaving and you’ll
      never see me again,” he responded.) In trance, of course, dialogue gives you an opportunity for interspersal as
      well (He told her, “Just make yourself comfortable.”).</p>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2">9.5.6 Suspense and Engagement of Interest</i></h4>

    <p class="noindent">Make your stories interesting enough for people to care and be curious about what happens in
      them and to the characters. Trance gives even more opportunity for suspense, since we often pause to match the
      breath and this sometimes leaves the listener curious a bit longer than in the usual telling of a tale.</p>

    <p class="indent">People get engaged when a character is in danger, confusion, or conflict, so including any of
      these elements can raise the suspense and engagement levels.</p>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2"><a id="calibre_link-294" class="calibre1"></a>9.5.7 Vague Enough to Allow
        for Identification and Imagination</i></h4>

    <p class="noindent">Think of how a fairy tale starts, as I mentioned earlier in the book: “Long ago, far away, there
      lived a young man who possessed a curious object. This is the story of what happened to him and how he learned the
      true nature of the object that was to change his life.”</p>

    <p class="indent">In my English class, they called this “climbing the ladder of abstraction” (see, I was paying
      attention). The more vague you can be, the more abstract the words and phrases, the more listeners are compelled
      to fill in the details with their imaginations. This element uses a skill we discussed in an earlier section on
      empty words.</p>

    <h4 class="chaptitab"><i class="calibre2">9.5.8 Enough Specific Details</i></h4>

    <p class="noindent">At the same time, too much vagueness might make the story too boring or not give the listener
      enough to hang onto. So, just as in using dialogue, put in enough specifics to give the person something to relate
      to. Include names, places, particular actions, sensory details using any or all of the senses, and so on.</p>

    <p class="centerimg"><img alt="" src="images/000074.jpg" class="calibre80" /></p>

        class="calibre5">10. Inclusion as Intervention</a></p>

    <p class="noindent">After using the solution-oriented approach to hypnosis for a while, some of the people with whom
      I worked starting remarking that the induction itself was healing for them even before I got into the actual
      intervention and treatment parts of the trance.</p>

    <p class="indent">One day a particular person mentioned that she had been to see a previous therapist who used
      hypnosis to treat her posttraumatic problems related to her experience of child sexual abuse. She said, “I like
      the kind of trance you do better than the type he used.” When I pressed her for more about that, she said: “He did
      working trances. I would go back to the past and reexperience the abuse. I felt exhausted and upset after each
      session. But I thought that’s what I needed to do to get better. You do healing trances. I don’t have to do
      anything; just be. At the end of those trances, something has changed and I feel better, more integrated.”</p>

    <p class="indent">After hearing that, I realized that there was something inherent in the very permissive approach
      that was healing, and I began to be more deliberate about both using and articulating the permissive aspects of
      the work. I started calling this inclusive therapy. (I have written a whole book on the subject, <i
        class="calibre2"><a id="calibre_link-296" class="calibre1"></a>A Guide to Inclusive Therapy</i>, also published
      by W.W. Norton, if you’d like to delve more into it.)</p>

    <p class="indent">There are two main aspects of inclusive therapy: <i class="calibre2">permission</i> and <i
        class="calibre2">inclusion</i>. I find them to be helpful for many people, but especially helpful for people who
      present with dissociation, shame, borderline issues, and posttraumatic problems.</p>

    <h3 class="chaptita"><a id="calibre_link-297" class="calibre1"></a><b class="calibre6"><a href="#calibre_link-111"
          id="calibre_link-74" class="calibre1">10.1 Permission</a></b></h3>

    <p class="noindent">The first element of inclusive therapy is permission. As in the induction part of this approach,
      we give people permission to experience whatever they are experiencing or will experience. This is why the
      approach is often helpful with shame issues. (“I shouldn’t feel this way or I must be this way” or “I won’t be
      okay.”)</p>

          Opposites</a></b></h3>

    <p class="noindent">The second element of inclusion taps into the nonrational aspects of trance: allowing two
      seeming opposites at the same time in one’s experience. This is in large part why inclusion can be helpful for
      those displaying or experiencing borderline issues, which often manifest as ambivalence (<i class="calibre2">I
        Hate You, Don’t Leave Me</i> is the title of a popular book on borderlines). The conscious rational mind tends
      to think in either/or or this/but that ways, while inclusion invites a both/and mind-set.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Where can you most fruitfully apply inclusion as a treatment in hypnotherapy? When there is
      ambivalence and where there are what transactional analysis calls <i class="calibre2">injunctions</i>. Injunctions
      are those rules (shoulds and shouldn’ts) that we often pick up from our cultures, our gender training, our parents
      and families, or decisions we make. (“I’ll never be hungry again,” vows Scarlett O’Hara.)</p>

    <p class="indent">Injunctions, like permissions, come in two forms: have to/should/ must and can’t/won’t/shouldn’t.
    </p>

    <p class="indent">If you can discern one of these rules that is dominating your client, come up with the opposite
      permission that might help undo the compulsion to live out the rule.</p>

        class="calibre5">12. Bad Trance/Good Trance</a></p>

    <p class="noindent">Here’s another concept you might find useful in thinking about hypnosis and hypnotherapy.
      Several writers have observed that hypnotic trance shows some marked similarities to some types of psychological
      or mental disturbances, like dissociative disorders and psychotic disorders. There is some truth to this view, and
      it makes one wonder: Why do these pathological symptoms feel subjectively disturbing and often lead to social and
      even legal problems for the person who experiences them, while people in trance often express a sense of delight
      at their experiences in trance?</p>

    <p class="indent">One way to think about this difference is that there are “symptom trances” and healing trances (or
      bad trances and good trances). The subjective phenomena are similar but the underlying sensibility is quite
      different.</p>

    <p class="indent">What distinguishes a bad trance from a good one? I suggest that one of the main differences is the
      experience of invalidation versus the experience of validation. In healing trances, we hypnotherapists are
      providing a validating and accepting relationship (I have to say, especially in this solution-oriented variety, in
      which validation, permission, and acceptance are such a cornerstone). In bad trance people are routinely
      invalidated by <a id="calibre_link-308" class="calibre1"></a>their contexts and other people (or even themselves
      through self-doubt and self-criticism).</p>

    <p class="indent">This is just an idea, but others (see the bibliography in this chapter) have explored the notion
      in different ways. Many have noted the similarity of trance experiences and psychotic or dissociative problems.
      Others have linked bad trance to family dysfunction and even torture. If this idea intrigues you, you might read
      their books to go more in depth on this subject.</p>

    <p class="indenta">I think of hypnotherapy as a way of shifting bad trances to good or healing ones. Below is a
      chart comparing and contrasting them.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Here is another overview that may help you get a bird’s-eye view of the process of offering
      hypnotherapy using this orientation.</p>

    <div class="extr">
      <p class="indent">1. Assess the complaints and identify the goals. Seed changes and create an expectancy for
        change.</p>

      <p class="indent">2. Determine that the complaint is an automatic process. (If it is not, pursue nonhypnotic
        interventions.)</p>

      <p class="indent">3. Introduce the notion of inner work and hypnosis. Reassure and reframe if necessary.</p>

      <p class="indent">4. Induce an inner focus, evoke resources, get responses, and help the person rearrange his or
        her experiential reality (splitting, linking, altering, deleting, and creating sensations and perceptions, and
        physiological, muscular, psychological, or emotional experiences). Offer a series of possibilities and notice
        which ones the person responds to.</p>

      <p class="indent">5. Link evoked resources and alterations to the future and to appropriate contexts.</p>

      <p class="indent">6. Complete the inner work or hypnosis.</p>

      <p class="indent">7. Discuss the experience as much or as little as the person <a id="calibre_link-312"
          class="calibre1"></a>wants. Normalize and reassure if necessary. Continue seeding changes and creating
        expectancies for change.</p>

      <p class="indent">8. At the next contact, gather information on postsession response and results and utilize
        those.</p>

      <p class="indent">9. Induce the inner state. Continue or expand the responses that helped. Offer new possibilities
        if necessary.</p>

      <p class="indent">10. Repeat steps 7&ndash;9 as often as necessary until both you and the client are certain you
        are complete. By complete, I mean that both you and the client are satisfied that all the relevant concerns have
        been addressed.</p>

      <p class="indent">11. Arrange for follow-up through scheduled visits, postcards, letters, phone calls, and so on.

    <p class="noindent">Okay, together we have taken a tour of trance land. Having used hypnosis in therapy for over 30
      years, I am still learning more about it and hope to keep learning more in the years to come.</p>

    <p class="indent">From my wanderings in this land, I have tried, through this book, to give you a map to find your
      way around. I hope I have made the tour sufficiently simple and empowering, so you now feel you can find your way
      on your own.</p>

    <p class="indent">I have actually learned more from the people with whom I have worked (commonly called subjects or
      clients but I prefer to think of them as people) than from any books or courses, but those books and courses got
      me started and gave me enough confidence to let people teach me. I hope this book has done the same for you.</p>
